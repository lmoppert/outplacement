# Outplacement
Tool to organize job search information

## Getting started

This application is based on the web framework
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) so you probably want a virtual Python
environment (e.g. use pipenv) and populate it with the configured packages from
the Pipfile. For the initialization of the application please refer to the
online documentation in [Django-Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/).
